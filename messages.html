February 12th:
Just remember that you’re one of the coolest and nicest people I know and you’re such a great leader to me both at work and outside of work! In the time I’ve known you, you’ve pushed me to be way better at work and also outside of work! I would only be like 1/10th of the snowboarder I am if I didn’t go boarding with you! I wish I could be 1/100th of the leader that you are and always pushing people to be better while still making them feel included and smile! You always seem to brighten the mood of everyone when you’re at work and you’re definitely my favorite coworker because of the amazing leader that you are
</p>

February 24th:
Have a great day at work! Just remember that you are the BEST leader! You’re an amazing leader but an even friend that is caring and kind! Thanks for being there for me and always somehow cheering me up and putting a smile on my face even when I’m in a terrible mood! I hope you crush it today and have a chill day without any drama or shitty customers! Keep being you and always pushing people to be better! I’m so glad I met you because you’ve made me better and always push myself ??????

Hey cutie! Just wanted to say that you are beautiful and gorgeous ??I’ve learned so much from you in such a short time and I’m so thankful for that! You’ve helped me out with even more than you know about and I’m sooooo thankful to you for that! You’ve taught me how to break out of my shell and talk about how I’m feeling and it’s already changed my life so much already! You’ve been there for me in some of my worst moments since I’ve been in Santa Fe, just being around you always helps me feel better and puts a smile on my face! Thank you for being such a good friend to me, you are definitely the BEST and I’m so glad I can call you my friend (even my best friend)! I hope today goes really well for you and if there’s anything I can help you out with at work or outside of work, let me know and I would be happy to help you! Just remember to breathe  and smile because you have such a gorgeous smile that lights up any room! I know your smile always brightens my day and your contagious laugh is so cute ??????????

March 11th:
Kayleigh Monique Fox ??, you are such a beautiful woman. I know I saw you 2 days ago and talked on the phone with you yesterday but I already miss seeing your beautiful smile, your cute smile and hearing your infectious laugh. I miss how you always say you hate me or call me names and then immediately smile. I miss seeing you at work and always having this overwhelming urge to give you a hug. I’m going to miss hanging out with you this week and being able to talk to you about anything. I’m going to miss boarding with you this week and just everything that goes along with that. The hour car ride where we talk and jam to music, the always stopping at the liquor store and getting recommendations on what to get, the funny moments on the lifts and the amount of progress we make every time we go out together. What I’m trying to say is I’m going to freaking miss you more than any words could explain ??I can’t wait to see you again and give you a big hug, hold you in my arms and give you cheek, forehead and nose kisses ??

Kayleigh Monique Fox ??, I miss you so freaking much. I wish I was camping with you right now.

I wish I could just hug you right now and hold you in my arms and give you kisses ??I hope you have a good rest of your trip, you can always message or call me if you want.

You are my favorite person in the whole wide world ??????????

March 16th:
Mine would probably be the Friday I drove back from Denver in February and talked to you the whole way back and then went to your place and hung out with you all evening and then you fell asleep laying on top of me while we were watching Harry Potter and then just cuddling/spooning with you all night ????

I’m attracted to you because you have a great personality, your playful by calling me names and that we can both roast each other without getting offended, you have similar interests to mine, you are such a great communicator that you somehow broke down my tough shell and got to know the real me,  we have similar interests and I can talk to you about anything without feeling like you’ll judge me ??

Babe, you know how I feel about you. I want to be with you. I love talking to you about anything and everything. I love spending an extra 10 minutes in the bathroom to spam you with mirror selfies. I love being able to talk to you about random things or sexual things that we want to do to each other. I love getting pics of you flipping me off to pics of you showing your bra, underwear, or nothing. I love how you always call me an idiot or dummy. I love that I can be myself with you. I love you ??

I can’t wait to kiss your face while you have a huge smile saying more more ??I can’t wait to look into your eyes and smile. I can’t wait to talk and laugh with you. I can’t wait to feel your fingers intertwined with mine. I can’t wait until you wax my stomach and give me a massage. I can’t wait to feel your hands on my body.
